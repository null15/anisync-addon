**AniSync** automatically synchronizes your anime progress with MyAnimeList and AniList in real-time as you stream, exposing watchlists as dynamic catalogs directly inside Stremio.

---

## Core Features

### 📺 Watchlist Airing Tags (`[New]`)
AniSync checks your watchlists against AniList schedules and places a clear `[New]` tag in front of currently airing anime titles whenever a new episode has aired that you haven't watched yet.

### 🗂️ Smart Three-Tier Watchlist Sorting
To make your "Currently Watching" watchlist catalog as useful as possible, AniSync automatically sorts and groups your active rows into three distinct tiers:
1. **Unwatched Airing Shows (Top)**: Airing series with newly released, unwatched episodes float to the absolute top of the row with the `[New]` tag so they are instantly accessible.
2. **Completed Series (Middle)**: Finished series that you are currently watching are grouped in the middle, sorted by your last watch update.
3. **Caught-Up Airing Shows (Bottom)**: Shows where you are fully caught up are pushed to the end of the row and sorted chronologically by when their next episode is scheduled to air. This serves as a countdown schedule, putting the soonest-airing shows first.


### 🚫 Episode Filler Indicators (`[Filler]`)
Using the Jikan (MAL) API, AniSync fetches episode lists and automatically prepends a `[Filler]` tag directly to the episode titles in Stremio's player detail overlay, letting you know exactly which episodes are safe to skip.
![Inline episode filler tag details](docs/images/episode_filler_tags.png)

* **Dual Account Syncing**: Connect both MyAnimeList and AniList simultaneously, keeping both watchlists updated in real-time as you play.
* **Draggable Watchlist Catalogs**: Browse your "Currently Watching", "Plan to Watch", "Completed", and other watchlist statuses as rows inside Stremio. You can toggle their visibility and drag-and-drop to reorder them on your dashboard.
* **Unified Kitsu Bridge**: Automatically maps MAL and AniList watchlists back to standard Kitsu IDs, ensuring stream providers (like Torrentio) find and serve playback links.
* **Zero-Lag Background Tracking**: Syncs progress asynchronously by listening to Stremio subtitle requests, meaning your player buffering/playback is never affected.
* **Fast Caching Engine**: Mappings and Jikan filler checks are cached in a local MongoDB instance using bulk page requests, reducing external API calls and keeping catalog loads under 100ms.
* **Web Configuration Dashboard**: A settings page to link your accounts, toggle features, reorder catalogs, and monitor server diagnostics in real-time.
* **High-Concurrency Scaling**: Engineered defensively for heavy simultaneous user loads. Employs a globally pooled keep-alive HTTP client registry (preventing socket/port exhaustion under peak load) and runs on a multi-process Uvicorn backend orchestration model.

### 🖥️ Web Configuration Dashboard
AniSync includes a responsive web configuration panel to manage your connections, toggle features, and customize catalog arrangements in real-time:

#### 🔐 Sign-in & Authentication

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting: Metadata Override Conflict (AnimeKitsu Addon)

If you have the **AnimeKitsu** addon installed, it might override AniSync's metadata during playback, which causes our `[Filler]` tags and custom titles to disappear in Stremio's player menu. 

Stremio resolves metadata conflicts by prioritizing whichever addon is **higher in your Stremio installed addons list**. There are two ways to fix this:

### Option A: Reorder your Addons (Highly Recommended)
1. Log in to the community-made **[Cinebye](https://cinebye.elfhosted.com/)** using your Stremio credentials.
2. Drag **AniSync** above **AnimeKitsu** in the list to reorder them.
3. Alternatively, simply uninstall both addons, then **install AniSync first** before reinstalling AnimeKitsu. Stremio will now prioritize our metadata and display the custom tags during playback.

### Option B: Dedicated Sync-Only Mode
If you prefer to let AnimeKitsu handle all of your catalogs and search, you can turn off `"Enable Watchlist Catalogs"` and `"Enable Catalog Search"` in your AniSync dashboard. This runs AniSync silently in the background solely to synchronize your watch progress, leaving Stremio's interface clean and conflict-free.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

#### Global Requirements
- Developer accounts for external integrations:
  - **MyAnimeList** API Client (Create at [MAL API Config](https://myanimelist.net/apiconfig))
  - **AniList** API Client (Create at [AniList Developer Settings](https://anilist.co/settings/developer))

#### Deployment-Specific Requirements
- **Option A / B (Docker hosting)**: [Docker & Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed on your VPS or device.
- **Option C (Vercel serverless hosting)**: A free cloud database cluster set up on **[MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/products/platform/atlas-database)**.

### 1. Environment Configuration

Clone this repository and create a `.env` file in the root based on `.env.example`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Fill in the necessary values:

```env
# App Settings
SECRET_KEY=generate-a-long-random-secret-string
FLASK_DEBUG=0
FLASK_RUN_HOST=yourdomain.com  # Public hostname (no protocol)

# MongoDB
MONGO_URI=mongodb://mongo:27017
MONGO_DB=anisync

# Proxy Support (Optional)
# Route all external API calls through a proxy (HTTP, HTTPS, SOCKS5).
# Perfect for bypassing rate limits at scale on a single server IP.
PROXY_URL=http://username:password@proxyhost.com:8080

# MyAnimeList OAuth Configuration
# Set the Redirect URI in MAL panel to: https://yourdomain.com/callback
MAL_CLIENT_ID=your_mal_client_id
MAL_CLIENT_SECRET=your_mal_client_secret

# AniList OAuth Configuration
# Set the Redirect URI in AniList panel to: https://yourdomain.com/anilist-callback
ANILIST_CLIENT_ID=your_anilist_client_id
```

### 2. Spinning Up Services with Docker

You can spin up AniSync either by pulling our pre-built Docker image from the GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) or by building the source code locally.

#### Option A: Pull Pre-built Image (Quickest & Recommended)

No need to clone the full repository or build the image locally. Simply create a new folder, create a `.env` file (configured as shown above) along with the `docker-compose.yml` file content below, and run:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

##### Pre-built `docker-compose.yml`

```yaml
services:
  app:
    image: ghcr.io/atharvkharbade/anisync-addon:latest
    container_name: anisync
    mem_limit: 1g
    memswap_limit: 2g
    env_file:
      - .env
    environment:
      - MONGO_URI=mongodb://mongo:27017
    depends_on:
      mongo:
        condition: service_healthy
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "python3", "-c", "import urllib.request; urllib.request.urlopen('http://localhost:5000/health')"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3
      start_period: 10s
    networks:
      - web-network
      - internal
    restart: unless-stopped

  mongo:
    image: mongo:7
    container_name: anisync-mongo
    mem_limit: 1g
    memswap_limit: 2g
    volumes:
      - mongo_data:/data/db
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "mongosh", "--eval", "db.adminCommand('ping')"]
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 5
    networks:
      - internal
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  mongo_data:

networks:
  web-network:
    external: true
  internal:
    driver: bridge
```

#### Option B: Build from Source (Developers)

If you have cloned the repository and want to build the container from local source code:

1. Build and start the services:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d --build
   ```
2. This starts:
   - **Quart Web Application** on port `5000` (bridged securely to your network manager).
   - **MongoDB 7** database daemon with automatic data volumes and health checks.

### 3. Hosting on Vercel (Serverless / One-Click)

If you prefer serverless hosting over a private server or Docker container, you can deploy AniSync to **Vercel**:

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fatharvkharbade%2Fanisync-addon&env=SECRET_KEY,FLASK_RUN_HOST,MONGO_URI,MONGO_DB,MAL_CLIENT_ID,MAL_CLIENT_SECRET,ANILIST_CLIENT_ID,PROXY_URL&project-name=anisync&repository-name=anisync)

#### Prerequisites for Vercel

Because Vercel is a serverless platform, it cannot host database engines. You will need a cloud-hosted MongoDB database:
1. Create a free database cluster on **[MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/products/platform/atlas-database)**.
2. In the MongoDB Atlas dashboard, click **Connect** -> **Drivers** and copy your Python/standard connection string.
3. Replace `<password>` in the connection string with your actual database user password. This is your `MONGO_URI` connection key.

#### Environment Setup on Vercel

When clicking the Deploy button, Vercel will ask you to supply the following environment variables:
* `SECRET_KEY`: A long, secure random secret string.
* `FLASK_RUN_HOST`: The actual domain Vercel assigns to your project (e.g., `my-anisync-addon.vercel.app` - do not include `https://`).
* `MONGO_URI`: Your MongoDB Atlas connection string.
* `MONGO_DB`: `anisync` (or your preferred database name).
* `MAL_CLIENT_ID`: Your MyAnimeList API client ID.
* `MAL_CLIENT_SECRET`: Your MyAnimeList API client secret.
* `ANILIST_CLIENT_ID`: Your AniList API client ID.
* `PROXY_URL` (Optional): Your HTTP/HTTPS/SOCKS5 proxy URL (e.g. `http://username:password@proxyhost.com:8080` or container-specific proxies like `http://glider:8443` if using a local Gluetun VPN container on your VPS).

---

## 🧭 Setup in Stremio

1. Navigate to your deployed instance (e.g. `https://yourdomain.com`).
2. Log in using **MyAnimeList** and/or **AniList** OAuth buttons.
3. Save your preferred configurations (e.g. enabling background sync, auto-adding unlisted series).
4. Copy the generated **Manifest URL** from the dashboard.
5. In the Stremio App:
   - Go to the **Addons** tab.
   - Paste the Manifest URL into the search bar at the bottom left.
   - Click **Install** and approve.
