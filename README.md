**AniSync** is a power-user-focused Stremio addon that automatically synchronizes your anime progress with MyAnimeList, AniList and Simkl in real-time. It enriches Stremio with poster badges (including support for RPDB overlays), airing indicators, episode filler & watched tags and personalized catalogs directly synced with your watchlists.

## 🌟 Features

### 📺 Poster Badges & Airing Indicators
Whenever a new episode drops for a show on your watchlist, AniSync overlays a clean `NEW EPISODE` banner directly on the poster in Stremio. If you connect multiple trackers, it overlays MyAnimeList, AniList and Simkl logos side-by-side.
* **RPDB Integration**: Optionally supply a Rating Poster DB (RPDB) API key to overlay rating logos directly on your posters.

### 🗂️ Combined Watchlist Catalogs
Connect MyAnimeList, AniList and Simkl simultaneously. AniSync merges and deduplicates your lists into single, clean catalogs in Stremio, auto-merging progress across trackers and supporting AniList re-watching series.

* **Gemini AI Enhancement**: Optionally supply a Gemini API key to personalize recommendation titles and generate custom themed lists.
